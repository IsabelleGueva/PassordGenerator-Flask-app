#Method <br>
Initially, I created the python code that would have a selection of characters, that could be selected under specific criteria. 
Then, using the random class, the program would generate a password that met all requirements and print it in the terminal.
A rough outline and criteria of the front-end was used for the first HTML and CSS draft. Later, functionality would be added 
by connecting python and static pages through Flask. From there, coding issues were resolved and added to have the front-end 
and back-end work together.
